**Sweep 'N Slash** is a total conversion add-on that introduces some of the combat aspects from Java Edition's 1.9 Combat Update into Bedrock Edition.

# How It Works

Minecraft Bedrock Edition's entities are data-driven, consisting of "components." Some of the mob behaviors are hard-coded, but many components can be overwritten with behavior packs. Attack component is one of them.
By setting the player entity's attack component value to a very large negative number, you can disable players' attacks entirely. This allows behavior packs to replace combat. This add-on makes use of that to add 1.9 combat aspects.

The major drawback of this method is that since it's most likely a bug, it causes unintended behaviors. And since everything is handled in server-side, it's not performance-friendly for large servers. (It was tested only in the LAN multiplayer.)

Also, since Bedrock's Scripting API lacks in reading/writing entity/item attribute components, it is not possible to read attack damage component for item stats. All the item stats have to be defined manually.

# Cross-Compatibility

This project uses [MCPE-IPC](https://github.com/OmniacDev/MCBE-IPC) for Cross-compatibility. It allows the add-on to have item stats defined by receiving scriptevents of item data from external behavior packs. This eliminates the hassle of having to modify the add-on's internal data.
